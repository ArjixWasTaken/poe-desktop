# PoeDesktop

The source code of the desktop app for poe.com is licenced under the [ISC licence](https://spdx.org/licenses/ISC.html),
as stated in the package.json located under the root directory.

Therefore I decided to upload a mirror of said code, since I couldn't find one online.
For now this is the untouched code, but I may decide to do modifications as it is allowed by the licence.
